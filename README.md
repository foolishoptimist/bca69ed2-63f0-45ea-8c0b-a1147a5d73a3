# ACER coding challenge

## Usage
After cloning the repo, checkout branch feature/assessment-reports
The following commands will run the app and tests respectively:
- docker-compose run app
- docker-compose run test

## Assumptions
I've setup the CLI to allow directly calling command with inline parameters for efficiency.
The user input behavior falls back to the specified behavior of prompting the user for the parameters when they are not entered.
